# Recipe_App
Hi, this is my simple app called Recipe which features a bunch of recipes. I've kept it intentionally straightforward to showcase my ability to create functional applications without investing significant time. The app includes authentication with email verification and consists of four screens.

The first screen is 'Explore,' where you can browse recipes and their categories. The second screen is a search screen, allowing you to find specific recipes. The third screen is the 'Favorites' list, displaying your favorite recipes. Finally, there's the 'Profile' screen, which showcases your basic profile data. It also lets you update your profile information, reset your password, and switch between dark and light modes.

I've kept the app simple because I didn't want to overcomplicate it, but if you have any ideas or Figma designs, I'm open to bringing them to life. Let's collaborate and turn your vision into reality!
